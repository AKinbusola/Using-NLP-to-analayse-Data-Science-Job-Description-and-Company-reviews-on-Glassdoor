# Using-NLP-to-analayse-Data-Science-Job-Description-and-Company-reviews-on-Glassdoor

In this project, I aim to analyze data science job descriptions and company reviews sourced from Kaggle and Glassdoor. The primary objectives include utilizing Text mining and Natural Language processing techniques to extract key words and identify the most frequently used terms within job descriptions. This information will be visualized through word clouds.

Additionally, I will extend the NLP analysis to company reviews, focusing on three prominent organizations: Allstate Insurance, Amazon, and BCG Company. By examining and interpreting the language used in reviews, I seek to gain insights into the sentiments and experiences shared by employees within these companies.

The datasets are too heavy, I will share the link to the dataset here:
